# 😂 The Ultimate Resume – Dr. Snortley Von Giggleton  
_A comedy-based UX portfolio built to break the internet_

---

## 📝 Project Description

**"The Ultimate Resume"** is an imaginative, satirical web-based portfolio designed for one of the most absurd and delightful job titles ever conceived: **Chief Laughter Optimization Engineer**. Built for the fictional yet legendary Dr. Snortley Von Giggleton, this project pushes the boundaries of conventional resume design by blending storytelling, comedy, UX flair, and narrative-driven interaction.

This isn’t just a resume — it’s an **entertainment experience disguised as a portfolio**. The core concept was to flip the seriousness of traditional career websites into something bizarre, hilarious, and wildly engaging — proving that even a résumé can go viral if designed with enough wit.
